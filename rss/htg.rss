The more I engage with that question, the more examples I find that could meet that need. (Most of these) cars were built strong in a time to meet strict quality requirements and were built to last. Sure, the clientele demanded high quality cars, but those same buyers have long since moved on. This abandonment means that there are quality-built GTs that still exist out there, some occupying second-hand dealer lots or having been traded in search of a new appreciative owner. One who will breathe new life into them. And in return, be rewarded with a few more years of enjoyment.</p>                    ]]></content:encoded><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 19:00:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.howtogeek.com/5-used-grand-tourers-you-can-buy-for-the-price-of-a-new-toyota-corolla/</guid></item>                                                                <item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Might Have to Pay You Back for Tricking You]]></title><link>https://www.howtogeek.com/amazon-might-have-to-pay-you-back/</link><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jorge A.
